# Stats-With-Python

This project is created to act as an overview of my understanding of intermediate stats and how I can relate it to the python programming. All functions were written by me expect for instances where it was necessary to use pandas and numpy to handle arrays and matrices.

The stats markdown file goes from creating a counting function up untill create a simple linear regression model and solves for the RMSE and R^2.
